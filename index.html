		<p>If there were one word I would use to describe myself it would be <i>evolving</i>. Over the years there have been many interactions and experiences in my life, each having helped me to grow and to gain insight into how to live a more fulfilling and rewarding life. Every experience, whether good or bad, has a lesson to be learned. I try not to take myself too seriously, and I have never been great at any one thing, but I feel as if I do many things well. I care about others and doing what is right, and try my best to work through every barrier preventing progress; if there is a way I <i>will</i> find it. I feel that I am a work in progress, and as soon as I stop being self-critical, will also be the day I stop learning.</p>
